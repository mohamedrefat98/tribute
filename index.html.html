            <p class="desc">Omar el Mokhtar is a national hero of  <strong>Libya</strong> . He was born in the town of Zanzur near Tobruk in the region of Cyrenaica under Ottoman control; young Omar lost his father early. For eight years he studied in the Koran school of Giarabub, the Senussi 's holy city. He taught in a Senussi zawiya but also took part in military operations against the Italians and the allies during<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war_i"> World War I</a>.<br><br>

               <span> In October 1911,</span> during the Italo-Turkish War, the Italian Royal Navy reached the shores of  <strong>Libya</strong>, then a territory subject to Ottoman Turkish control. They demanded that the Turkish administration and garrison surrender their territory to the Italians or incur the immediate destruction of the city of Tripoli and Benghazi. The Turks and their  <strong>Libya</strong>n allies withdrew to the countryside instead of surrendering, and the Italians bombarded the cities for three days. This marked the beginning of a series of battles between the Italian colonial forces and the  <strong>Libya</strong>n armed opposition in Cyrenaica.<br><br>
                
               <span> In 1912,</span> the Italians invaded  <strong>Libya</strong>. Omar repeatedly led his small, highly alert groups in successful attacks against the Italians, after which they would fade back into the desert terrain. Omar’s men skilfully attacked outposts, ambushed troops, and cut lines of supply and communication. He was also skilled in the strategies and tactics of desert warfare. He knew local geography well and used that knowledge to advantage in battles against the Italians, who were unaccustomed to desert warfare.<br><br>
                
                After the Fascist coup in Italy  <span> in 1922</span>, the situation in  <strong>Libya</strong> changed and the pressure on the king of  <strong>Libya</strong> Idriss As-Senussi intensified. <br><br>
                
               <span> In 1922,</span> As-Senussi was exiled to Egypt. <span> In 1923,</span> after Omar became sure of the Italian intentions, he travelled to Egypt to consult with Senussi. After his return, Omar was among the most competent and active figures in organizing and coordinating the resistance. In his capacity as representative of the Senussi he had assumed command of the guerrilla forces that often baffled and confounded the regular Italian forces. <br><br>
                
                In the mountainous region of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Mountains"> Gabal Akhdar (the Green Mountain)</a>, the Italian Governor succeeded <span> in 1924</span> in activating a counter-guerrilla force that inflicted a harsh defeat on the rebels <span>in  1925</span>. Omar then quickly modified his own tactics and was able to count on constant help from Egypt.
                
                Between <span> 1927 and 1928</span> Omar fully reorganized the forces.<br><br>
                
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Badoglio"> Pietro Badoglio</a>, the new governor of  <strong>Libya</strong> <span>(January 1929),</span> after extensive negotiations was able to reach a compromise with Omar similar to previous Italo-Senusite accords. Italian sources falsely described the situation as an act of complete submission by Omar. At the end of <span> October 1929</span> Omar denounced the compromise and reestablished a unity of action among  <strong>Libya</strong>n forces, preparing himself for the ultimate confrontation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Graziani"> General Rodolfo Graziani</a>, the military commander from<span> March 1930</span>.<br><br>
                
                Having failed in a massive offensive in June against Omar's forces, Rodolfo, in full accord with Badoglio, De Bono (minister of the colonies), and Benito Mussolini, initiated a strong plan to decisively break off the Cirenaica resistance. The plan was to transfer the Gebel population to concentration camps on the coast and to close the border with Egypt from the coast at Giarabub, thus preventing any foreign help to the fighters and breaking up the solidarity of the population.<br><br>
                
                From the beginning of 1931 the measures taken by Graziani took their toll on the Senusist resistance. The rebels were deprived of help and reinforcements.<br><br>
                
                In spite of hardships and increasing risks, Omar courageously continued the fight, but on September 11, 1931, he was ambushed near Zonta. With dignity and calm he faced up to the immediate situation and accepted his death sentence with the words: "From God we came and to God we must return." The execution of the old fighter—carried out in the concentration camp of Solluq on September 16—caused great indignation in the Arab world.</p>
